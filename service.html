As yoga does not discriminate, all levels are invited to practice. Whether it is your first time, or your 100th, your experience will be just as freeing, and calming. With the room temperature slightly warmer, your body will begin relaxing the moment you enter the room and the energy from the class will make you feel free and at ease.
